# Dataset

The dataset is publicly available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yudhaislamisulistya/plants-type-datasets)

# Model 
Due to computational limitations, the train model will be trained with 3 classes: bananas,coconuts, and aloevera.
Here's a table of the models I've experimented with, along with their respective accuracy:

| Model  | Accuracy |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| MobileNet V2  | 80%  |


# Usage 

The demo can be used 
```
python -m streamlit run app.py
```
